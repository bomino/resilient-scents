question: "How long does the scent last?"
---

Most customers experience 6-8 hours of noticeable fragrance, with a subtle skin scent lasting even longer. Longevity depends on your skin type (oily skin holds scent longer), application areas, and environmental factors. Layering with unscented lotion can extend wear time.
