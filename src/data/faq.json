    "question": "What makes Resilient Scents body oils different?",
    "answer": "Our body oils are crafted with premium carrier oils like jojoba, sweet almond, and argan that actually nourish your skin while delivering long-lasting fragrance. Unlike alcohol-based perfumes that evaporate quickly and can dry skin, our oils meld with your natural chemistry, creating a scent that's uniquely yours."

    "question": "How long does the scent last?",
    "answer": "Most customers experience 6-8 hours of noticeable fragrance, with a subtle skin scent lasting even longer. Longevity depends on your skin type (oily skin holds scent longer), application areas, and environmental factors. Layering with unscented lotion can extend wear time."

    "question": "Where should I apply body oil?",
    "answer": "Focus on pulse points where blood vessels are close to the skin — wrists, neck, behind ears, inside elbows, and behind knees. These warm areas help diffuse the fragrance. You can also apply to hair ends or clothing for a softer effect."
